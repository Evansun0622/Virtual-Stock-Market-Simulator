# Stock Simulator
  
Comp426 Final Project
  
## Introduction
  
This web app is intended to provide a simulation of the real stock market. Every user is given an initial amount of 100,000 dollars, which they can use to purchase a variety of stocks. User can also search for a particular stock and view its information. For each stock, we provide a line chart of its price for the last three years so that user can do some analysis. We also provide the most recent market news for user to make better decisions.
   
## Tech Stack
 
We used React.js as our frontend framework, and Express, Node as the backend framework. We store user's information in Mongodb and the deploy the database on MongoDB Atlas.
The 3rd party API that we used are https://finnhub.io/ and https://www.tiingo.com/, one for retreiving the latest market news and one for retrieving the stock price.
