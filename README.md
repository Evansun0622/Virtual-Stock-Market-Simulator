# Stock Simulator

Comp426 Final Project

## Introduction

This web app is intended to provide a simulation of the real stock market. Every user is given an initial amount of 100000 dollars, which they can use to purchase a variety of stocks. For each stock, we provide a line chart of its price for the last three years so that user can do some analysis. We also provide the most recent market news for user to make better decisions.
